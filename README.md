## portfolio

My personal portfolio. Features a JavaScript client and CMS which consumes a Node.JS RESTful API backend. Also includes a GruntJS based approach for automated building, testing and deployment.

I've added the code to GitHub (sans sensitive configuration files, naturally!) so that prospective employers, clients and colleagues can review and get an idea of the sort of standards I work to.

### API

The JavaScript client and CMS feed off a NodeJS RESTful API.
