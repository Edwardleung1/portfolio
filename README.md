## portfolio

My personal portfolio. Features a JavaScript client and CMS which consumes a Node.JS RESTful API backend. Also includes a GruntJS based approach for automated building, testing and deployment.

I've added the code to GitHub, sans sensitive configuration files, so that prospective employers, clients and colleagues can have a snoop around my code. As a learning process I've deliberately tried to roll my own solutions and code rather than grabbing the nearest framework or library.

Take a look at the live version here (seisaku.co.uk)[http://seisaku.co.uk].

### API

The JavaScript client and CMS feed off a NodeJS RESTful API.
